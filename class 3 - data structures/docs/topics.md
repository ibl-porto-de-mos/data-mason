# Class 3: Data Structures

## Overview
Data structures help organize and store data efficiently. We'll cover lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples.

## Key Concepts
- **List**: Ordered, mutable collection.
- **Dictionary**: Key-value pairs.
- **Set**: Unordered, unique elements.
- **Tuple**: Ordered, immutable collection.

## Christian Example: Gospel Stories
Use a list for disciples, a dict for Bible books, a set for unique virtues, and a tuple for immutable commandments.

### Code Example
```python
# List of disciples
disciples = ["Peter", "John", "James"]
disciples.append("Andrew")  # Add to list

# Dictionary of Bible books
bible_books = {"Genesis": "Creation", "Exodus": "Deliverance"}
print(bible_books["Genesis"])

# Set of virtues
virtues = {"Faith", "Hope", "Love"}
virtues.add("Patience")

# Tuple of commandments
commandments = ("Honor God", "Love neighbor")
print(commandments[0])
```

## Exercises
1. Create a list of parables and sort them.
2. Use a dict to map apostles to their roles.
