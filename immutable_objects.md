# Presentation
### Main topic: Immutable objects in Python

## What's a immutable object?
Immutable objects in Python are the objects that, after it's creation, is not able to change it's composition.    
The immutable objects are: The tuples, strings, ints and floats

## About the tuples
The tuples are a type of list that fits strings, floats and ints but, after it's creation, the only way to "change" its compositions is by re-doing the code.

## About the strings
The strings is any kind of numbers, letters or/and symbols between single/double quotation marks('' or "")

## About Ints and floats
Ints are numbers WITHOUT a floating point, but the floats are the opposites, since it needs a floating point(.)

# Conclusion
to end the presentation, the immutable objects are safer to multi-threaded applications, because you can do your codes in peace, without wprrying about the data being changed by other threads but, if the value needs to be changed or you need to modify, it will definetly be less efficient then a modifying in a mutable object, since you'll need to recreate the object.
