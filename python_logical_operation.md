# Operations in Python.

These operations are used when we want the computer to make decisions based on true or false conditions.

In other words, they work with Boolean values, which can only be True or False.



⸻



1. And operator



The and operator means ‘and’.

It only returns True if both conditions are true.

For example:



age = 20

has_license = True

print(age > 18 and has_license)  # True



If I say that the age is greater than 18 and the person has a driver's license, the result will be true only if both things are true."







2. Or operator



“The or operator means ‘or’.

It returns True if at least one of the conditions is true.

For example:



raining = False

has_umbrella = True

print(raining or has_umbrella)  # True



Even if it is not raining, since the person has an umbrella, the result is true.”









 3. Not operator



“The not operator reverses the logical value.

If something is True, not turns it into False, and vice versa.

For example: 



turned_on = False

print(not turned_on)  # True



”Here, since turned_on is false, not turned_on becomes true.”









Conclusion



“These operators — and, or, and not — are used all the time in programs to make decisions.

They are very important in structures such as if, while, and other conditions.

Understanding how they work helps programmers make computers act according to various
