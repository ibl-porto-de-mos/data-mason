# Basic data types
In Python, basic data types are the forms that the program uses to represent information, such as numbers, texts, logical values and even the absence of value

They are called basic because they serve as the foundation for everything we build in Python

Every variable, every calculation and every comparison depend on these types

Among the most important types are:

Boolean, Numeric and Text types.

1. BOOLEAN type (bool)

They represent values of truth. They have only two possible values:

•	 True

•	 False

They usually appear when we make comparisons between two values

Comparison operators:

== equal

! = different

< less than

<= smaller or equal

> bigger than

>= greater or equal

Is (same object)

Is not  (same object)

Examples:

A=2

B=3

A == b False (because 2 is not equal to 3)

A! = b True (because they are different)

A < b True (because 2 is less than 3)

2. Numeric Types (numerical types)

Python has three basic numerical types:

Int - Whole numbers

They represent positive, negative or zero values and without decimal places

A=21

B=-3

C=234

Float - Decimal numbers

They are numbers with decimal places (in Python the period is used as a separator)

D = 2.33

E = 9.99

Complex - Complex numbers

They represent numbers with real part and imaginary part, using j to indicate the imaginary part

Format:

a + bj

Example:

Z = 3 + 5j

Z.real → 3.0

Z.imag → 5.0

It is widely used in advanced mathematics...

3. Text Type (str)

Represents text, that is, a string of characters. It is defined in single or double quotes.

Name = "Leticia"

Message = 'Good morning!'
